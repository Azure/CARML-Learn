# Common Azure Resource Modules Library - Lab

***Note*** - These Labs were originally developed for the Microsoft 2022 SPARK Conference. While Lab 0, Lab 2, and Lab 7 have been updated as recently as January 2023 as a guide for new CARML contributors, the other Labs may contain outdated content.

This Wiki hosts labs for the _'Common Azure Resource Modules Library (CARML)'_.

As the repository is a living entity, labs map to a specific CARML release.
