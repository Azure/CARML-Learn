# Step 1 - Create Azure Service Principal and Configure Access to Subscription

CARML tests the deployments and stores the module artifacts in an Azure subscription. To do so, it requires a service principal with access to it.

This step will guide you in the creation of the Service Principal and the gathering of the required values that will be used in the next steps.

For this lab, it is enough to just write them temporarily in for example Notepad. You should have notes for the following pieces:

- Application (Client) ID
- Service Principal Object ID
- Service Principal Secret (password)
- Tenant ID
- Subscription ID
- Parent Management Group

There are two alternatives to execute this step. Please, choose the one you prefer and move to Step 2 afterwards.

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative 1: Via the Az CLI</b></summary>

The following commands will allow us to:

- Login to Azure using Az CLI.
- Create a new Service Principal.
- Assign the Service Principal `Owner` role at subscription level.

> If you don't want to give Owner permissions to the Service Principals other options will be provided as part of the steps.

1. As a first step, in the Azure portal, you have to navigate to your subscription by using for example the search bar on the top.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionSearch.png" alt="Subscription search" height="170">

1. Following, select the subscription you want to grant access to. In the below example it is called `Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription`.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionSelect.png" alt="Subscription select" height="230">

1. This brings you to the overview of your subscription. Here you need to perform 2 tasks:
   - Make note of the `Subscription ID` for later reference
   - Make note of the `Parent Management Group` for later reference

    <p>

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/portalSubscriptionOverview.png" alt="Subscription overview" height="220">

1. Navigate back to your local Visual Studio Code and select the PowerShell `Terminal` that should be open on the lower end of VSCode. If `Terminal` is not in sight, you can alternatively open it by expanding the `Terminal`-dropdown on the top, and selecting `New Terminal`.

1. Now, login to Azure by executing:

    ```PowerShell
    az login
    ```

1. Select the right subscription you want to work in by executing the following command. Update the `<subscription id>` with your Subscription Id. This will start an interactive login session opening your default web browser.

    ```Powershell
    az account set --subscription "<subscription id>"
    ```

1. Create a new Service Principal with `Owner` permissions at subscription level by executing the following command:

    ```Powershell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<<service-principal-name>>" --role "Owner" --sdk-auth --output "json"
    ```

If you don't want to assign **Owner**, you can also choose **Contributor** in combination with **User Access Administrator**. For this second role assignment you will need to execute the following command:

    ```Powershell
    az role assignment create --assignee "<<service-principal-name>>" --role "User Access Administrator"
    ```

1. The below output will be returned when the service principal has been created. Make sure you copy these values in a Notepad, for instance.

    ```JSON
    {
        "clientId": "<client_id>",
        "clientSecret": "<client_secret>",
        "subscriptionId": "<subscriptionId>",
        "tenantId": "<tenant_id>",
        (...)
    }
    ```
    > ***Note:*** Make sure to write these things down as you will need them in the next Lab. Especially the password since it can't be retrieved twice.

1. Lastly, you need to gather the Object Id of the Service Principal you just created. You can do so by executing the following command:

    ```Powershell
    az ad sp list --display-name "<service-principal-name>" --query "[].objectId" --output tsv
    ```

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>Alternative 2: Via the Azure Portal</b></summary>

### Create the Service Principal

1. Open the Azure Portal via the URL [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalHome.png" alt="Portal Home" height="200">

1. Navigate to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using for example the search bar on the top.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSearchAAD.png" alt="Portal Search AAD" height="190">

1. Here we want to do 2 things:
   - Make note of your `Tenant ID` in the displayed `Overview` for later reference
   - Further select `App registrations` in the blade to the left

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalAzureAD.png" alt="Portal AAD Home" height="400">

1. In the opening view select `+ New registration` on the top.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalAzureADAppRegistrations.png" alt="Portal AAD App Registration Overview" height="180">

1. In the opening form, please provide a name of your choice and select `Register`. All other options can remain as is.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalAzureADAppCreate.png" alt="Portal AAD App Registration" height="600">

1. This will open the created application's overview. Here we again want to do 2 things:
   - Make note of the `Application (client) ID` for later reference
   - Navigate to the application's underlying service principal by selecting its name on the right side of the application's overview

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalAzureADAppView.png" alt="Portal AAD App View" height="200">

1. Here you have to perform 2 tasks:
   - Make note of the service principal's `Object ID`    for later reference
   - Further, navigate back to the created application's overview by going back in your browser

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalAzureADAppViewSPView.png" alt="" height="200">

1. Back on the application, you again have to perform 2 tasks:
   - Select `Certificates & secrets` in the blade to the left
   - Select `+ New client secret` in the opening view to the right

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalAzureADAppSecretCreate.png" alt="Portal AAD App Secret Create" height="300">

1. Now enter a name for the secret, and click on `Add`.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalAzureADAppSecretCreateBlade.png" alt="Portal AAD App Secret Create Blade" height="150">

1. The previous step created a new secret for the application which is shown to us now. Please make note of the secret value as it will only be visible until we leave this view.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalAzureADAppSecretView.png" alt="Portal AAD App Secret View" height="300">

### Grant Service principal access to subscription

Now that we have a new service principal, we must grant it access on the subscription we want to test later deployments in.

1. As a first step, you have to navigate to your subscription by using for example the search bar on the top.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionSearch.png" alt="Subscription search" height="170">

1. Following, select the subscription you want to grant access to. In the below example it is called `Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription`.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionSelect.png" alt="Subscription select" height="230">

1. This brings you to the overview of your subscription. Here you need to perform 3 tasks:
   - Make note of the `Subscription ID` for later reference
   - Make note of the `Parent Management Group` for later reference
   - Further select  `Access control (IAM)` in the blade to the left

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionView.png" alt="Subscription overview" height="220">

1. In the opened `Access control (IAM)` view, select `+ Add` on the top.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAM.png" alt="Role assignment overview" height="170">

1. In the opening drop-down, select `Add role assignment`.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAMAdd.png" alt="Role assignment init" height="170">

1. This opens a new view with 3 tabs we have to navigate through. First, you must select the `Role` we want to assign. For this lab we recommend to use the `Owner` role, as the CI platform tests both resource deployments, as well as role assignments. If you don't want to assign `Owner`, you can also choose `Contributor` in combination with `User Access Administrator`. In either case, you can use the search to search for the roles you want to assign and select them in the list below it.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAMAddRole.png" alt="Role assignment select role" height="260">

1. Next, navigate to the `Members` tab and click on `+ Select members`.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAMAddRoleMember.png" alt="Role assignment member initial" height="275">

1. In the opening blade, search for the name of the application you created (in this example it is `MyApplication`), make sure you **select** the application, and click on `Select` on the bottom of the blade.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAMAddRoleMemberBlade.png" alt="Role assignment select member" height="250">

1. This will close the blade and show the application in the `Members` view as shown in the image below.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAMAddRoleMemberView.png" alt="Role assignment member selected" height="275">

1. Finally, select the `Review + assign` tab which shows you an overview of the configuration and click on the `Review + assign` button on the bottom to conclude the role assignment.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAMAddFinal.png" alt="Role assignment Review" height="310">

1. This will close the view and we can confirm that the role assignment worked by searching for the application in the search and selecting your application in the `Check access` section. Be aware that it may take a few seconds for the role assignment to finish.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAMViewSearch.png" alt="Role assignment check access search" height="300">

1. In the opening blade you can see that the application indeed is configured with the expected role(s) for the current subscription.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqAzure/portalSubscriptionIAMViewSearchConfirm.png" alt="Role assignment check access" height="120">

# Step 2 - Create your fork

In **CARML**, you can't work directly in the `main` branch, so the first action to be taken is to _fork_ the repository.

> One of the fundamental features in version control systems, branching and forking are fundamentals to collaboration.
>
> A **branch** in Git creates another line of development in the project without affecting the main branch.
>
> **Fork**, on the other hand, is a clone of the repository on a different organization and you can do it even if you don't have contribution rights on the main repo.

1. Open to the repository via the URL [aka.ms/CARML](https://aka.ms/CARML)

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/carmlMain.png" alt="Repository main" height="240">

1. Select the `Fork` button on the top right and select the organization you'd like to fork into. For this lab we recommend to use your own organization as this ensures you will have all the permissions you need.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/carmlFork.png" alt="Repository Fork" height="180">

1. Once triggered, the repository will take a moment to be set up.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/carmlForkingInProgress.png" alt="Forking in progess" height="160">

1. Once done, you will automatically be forwarded to your repository.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/carmlForkFinal.png" alt="Forked repository" height="250">

# Step 3 - Configure your repository

Now you need to configure several secrets that are leveraged by the solution's workflows. Most notably for example, the service connection.

To do that you have to perform the following steps in sequence:

1. Navigate to the repository's `Settings`.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/forkSettings.png" alt="Navigate to settings" height="100">

1. In the list of settings, expand `Secrets` and select `Actions`. You can create a new repository secret by selecting `New repository secret` on the top right.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/forkSettingsSecrets.png" alt="Navigate to secrets" height="600">

1. In the opening view, you can create a secret by providing a secret `Name`, a secret `Value`, followed by a click on the `Add secret` button.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/forkSettingsSecretAdd.png" alt="Add secret" height="600">

    The values of the secrets are the ones we collected in [Step 1](#step-1---create-azure-service-principal-and-configure-access-to-subscription) of this lab. You'll need to create one secret for each entry in the following table and make sure you use the exact same naming:

    | Secret Name | Example | Description |
    | - | - | - |
    | `ARM_MGMTGROUP_ID` | `de33a0e7-64d9-4a94-8fe9-b018cedf1e05` / `my-mg` | The group ID of the management group to test deploy modules of that level in. |
    | `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | `d0312b25-9160-4550-914f-8738d9b5caf5` | The subscription ID of the subscription to test deploy modules of that level in. |
    | `ARM_TENANT_ID` | `9734cec9-4384-445b-bbb6-767e7be6e5ec` | The tenant ID of the tenant to test   deploy modules of that level in. |
    | `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` | See below | See below |
    <!-- | <s>PLATFORM_REPO_UPDATE_PAT</s> | - | For this lab, this secret is optional and can be **ignored**. It would be used to sync the repository's `docs` folder with the repository's wiki. However, for the sake of this lab we will ignore it for now. If you are interested, you can find further information [here](https://github.com/Azure/ResourceModules/blob/main/docs/wiki/PipelinesDesign.md#github-component-github-secrets). | -->

    - Special case: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`,
      This secret represents our service connection to Azure and its value is a compressed JSON object that must match the following format:

      ```JSON
      {"clientId": "<client_id>", "clientSecret": "<client_secret>", "subscriptionId": "<subscriptionId>", "tenantId": "<tenant_id>" }
      ```

      **Make sure you create this object as one continuous string as shown above** - using the information you collected during Step 1 of this lab. Failing to format the secret as above, results in masked strings (`***`) in place of `{` and `}` in the workflow logs as it is considering each line of the json object as a separate secret string. If you're interested, you can find more information about this object [here](https://github.com/Azure/login#configure-deployment-credentials).

# Step 4 - Configure code base

<!-- As the platform tests services in Azure, you have to ensure that those services with globally unique naming requirements are set up accordingly. This must happen in two places:

- The individual module parameter files
- The shared dependency pipeline

The platform, by default, will publish the modules on _Azure Container Registry_, that also requires a globally unique name. You will need to set a unique name for it too. -->

## Clone the repository

To perform these changes as quickly and easily as possible, we recommend to update the code base using a local clone of the code in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). To do so, please perform the following steps:

1. On the overview page of your fork, select the `<> Code` button to the right, and select the copy button in the opening pop up to copy the URL we need to clone the repository.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/forkClone.png" alt="Clone fork" height="250">

1. On your local machine you can clone the repository to any location you desire. However, it is recommended to keep the local file paths short.
    >Example: `C:/dev/CARML/lab`

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/localFolder.png" alt="Local folder" height="150">

    There are different ways you can achieve this:

    <details>
    <summary><b>Alternative 1:</b> Using VSCode</summary>

    1. Open Visual Studio Code and further navigate to the Terminal. If a Terminal is not in sight, you can alternatively open it by expanding the `Terminal`-dropdown on the top, and selecting `New Terminal`

    1. In the Terminal, type `cd <Path>`, and replace `<Path>` with the local file path you'd like to clone your fork to (for example `cd 'C:/dev/CARML/lab'`)

    1. Next, type `git clone '<URL>'`, replace `<URL>` with the URL you copied before and confirm the execution.

    1. Following the execution you can now open the downloaded clone via the file explorer on the top left

        <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/vsCodeOpenFolder.png" alt="Open file explorer" height="180">

    1. Navigate to the extracted folder, select it and trigger the `Select Folder` button

       <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/vsCodeSelectFolder.png" alt="Select folder" height="350">

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary><b>Alternative 2:</b> Using the Terminal</summary>

    1. In the folder you chose, perform a right-click and select `Open in Windows Terminal` to open a new PowerShell session with the path set to the current folder.

        <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/localTerminalOpen.png" alt="Open local terminal" height="230">

    1. In the Terminal type `git clone '<URL>'`, replace `<URL>` with the URL you copied before and confirm the execution.

        <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/localTerminalClone.png" alt="Clone in terminal" height="180">

    1. Following the execution you will find that there is now a `ResourceModules` folder.

        <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/localFolder.png" alt="Local Folder" height="150">

    1. Next, back in the Terminal, execute the command `code ./ResourceModules` to open Visual Studio Code in the clone repository folder.

        <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/localCodeCarml.png" alt="CARML in VSCode" height="450">

    </details>

    <p>

## Update default namePrefix

To lower the barrier to entry and allow users to easily define their own naming conventions, we introduced a default "name prefix" for all deployed resources.

Each pipeline in CARML that deploys resources uses a logic that automatically replaces "tokens" (i.e. placeholders) in any module test file. Tokens are stored in only a few central locations to facilitate maintenance (e.g., local settings.yml, repository secrets or variable groups)..

To update the namePrefix, perform the following steps:

1. Open the `settings.yml` file in the repository's root directory.

2. Replace the value of the `localToken_namePrefix` with a different value:

    ```yml
    localToken_namePrefix: 'cntso'
    ```

    > **NOTE:** The value should be a 3-5 character long string like `cntso`. Longer strings are not recommended as they may conflict with Azure resource name length restrictions.

    > **NOTE:** The CI pipelines automatically removes the localToken_ prefix from the name when processing the tokens replacement.

## Commit your changes to main

You now need to push the changes in the repo. You can do this in two ways:


<details>
<summary><b>Alternative 1: Via VSCode's terminal</b></summary>

1. If a Terminal is not in sight, you can alternatively open it by expanding the `Terminal`-dropdown on the top, and selecting `New Terminal`

1. Now, execute the following PowerShell commands:

    ```PowerShell
    git add .
    git commit -m 'Update settings'
    git push
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative 2: Via VSCode's UI</b></summary>

1. Add your changes: If not already there, navigate to the source control menu to the left and add the changed files to the commit. To do so, select the `+` icon next to the `settings.yml` file

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/gitadd_02.png" alt="Open source control" height="130">

1. Commit your changes: Next, you should give the commit a meaningful message such as 'Update settings' and can then click the checkmark symbol on the top to create the commit

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/gitcommit_02.png" alt="Git commit">

1. Push your changes: Finally, you can push the changes to the repository by selecting the blue `Sync Changes` button

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/gitpush.png" alt="Git push" height="120">

</details>

> Forgot to configure git?
>
> If you get an issue regarding configuring git user name and email, run the following commands with your info:
>
> ```PowerShell
> git config --global user.name "John Doe"
> git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"
> ```

<p>

# Step 5 - Create a branch

By default, CARML uses pipeline triggers to automate for example the publishing of a new module once a corresponding PR is merged.

To this end, the trigger is set up to look for any changes in the `main` branch if any module or pipeline file was modified.

As you don't want to accidentally trigger any pipelines, you should hence create a branch to perform your tasks on throughout the rest of the lab.

You can do this in one of two ways:

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative 1: Via VSCode's terminal</b></summary>

1. If a Terminal is not in sight, you can alternatively open it by expanding the `Terminal`-dropdown on the top, and selecting `New Terminal`

1. Now, execute the following PowerShell commands:

    ```PowerShell
    git checkout -b 'carmlLab'
    git push --set-upstream 'origin' 'carmlLab'
    ```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative 2: Via VSCode's UI</b></summary>

1. Select the current branch on the bottom left of VSCode

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/initBranchMain.png" alt="Change branch main" height=80>

1. Select `+ Create new branch` in the opening dropdown

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/createBranchUI.png" alt="Init create branch" height=70>

1. Enter the new branch name `carmlLab`


    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab2/createBranchName.png" alt="Enter name" height=70>

1. Push the new branch to your GitHub fork by selecting `Publish Branch` to the left in the 'Source Control' tab

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20Lab3/gitpush.png" alt="Git push" height=100>

</details>

<p>

# Step 6 - Enable actions

Finally, the 'GitHub Actions' are disabled by default. Hence, in order to continue with the rest of the lab and execute any pipelines you have to enable them first.

To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `Actions` tab on the top of the repository page.

    <img src="./media/v0.4.0%20-%20PreReqGitHub/actionsOverview.png" alt="Navigate to actions" height="150">

1. Next, select '`I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`'.
